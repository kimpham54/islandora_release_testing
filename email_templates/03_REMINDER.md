Hi All,

Just a reminder that the testing deadline for the Islandora 7.x-1.11 release is this Friday. If anyone has any questions, or are experiencing roadblocks to get the testing finished by the deadline, you can get in touch with me at kimpham54@gmail.com. 

Thanks!

Individual email:

I wanted to check in with you because you had a couple components to test under https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PRv2Xo-sNE_sDJHUT5OvTXmNiSHnkdJgwo7VsFkIUgY/edit#gid=1390884710 that are marked as 'To Do'. 

If you want any help with testing to make tomorrow's deadline, or require an extension, let me know and I can help.

Thanks!
